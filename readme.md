Hi! How are you doing today?
This project is the primary version of my Portifolio. It's not sophisticated but it's a start. I'm currently studying this field and I want to demonstrate what I've been learning. 
I hope I can find people here that can inspire-me and give-me my first opportunity to demonstrate my skills in this field. 
I want to share with you my evolution in this learning journey...
